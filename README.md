# Introduction
This respository is designed to allow for the reproducibility of ``Uncertainty quantification for wide-bin unfolding: one-at-a-time strict bounds and prior-optimized confidence intervals" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01091).

This codebase is setup to be run from scratch (i.e., you get to generate everything yourself), or from pre-computed objects (i.e., smearing matrices, data, etc.).
